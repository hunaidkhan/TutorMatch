Inspiration
Students have a tough workload and Coronavirus just contributed to the stress of a student. Our goal is to help students who are less fortunate and may not be able to afford tutors and to make it easily accessible in general. To add on, there are many parts of the world in which education is not easily accessible but luckily through the internet, we can help everyone learn and better educate people around us.

What it does
Our website has highly trained tutors that students can choose from. The student can schedule a tutor and the tutor will help the student in any way the student needs. We remove the extra step of payment and other hassles and allow students to get right into learning.

How we built it
we looked from the perspective of a student trapped in his screen and built a very user-friendly website

Challenges we ran into
As beginners in coding, specifically in web development, we were forced to learn the entire framework and the language in one night. That was one of the biggest challenge. Along with the difficulty of managing time, we had a hard time implementing the database structure of the tutors into our project.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
An accomplishment we are proud of is being able to submit a fully functioning website that would genuinely help kids. Along with that, another accomplishment was learning how to code in web development and making a website that works successfully.

What we learned
Through the intensive learning conditions we learned how to stay calm under pressure and we learned the importance of teamwork in a group project.

What's next for Tutor Match
After this, we would like to work more on the data base part of the code once we have more time. Figuring out how to make the database structure of the tutors with the given time was difficult, which is why we would like to educate ourselves after HackVH.
